# InferLab

InferLab is one evolving system for learning how production LLM inference works—from an HTTP request entering a distributed gateway to a token leaving an optimized kernel.

The project has two equally important outputs:

1. a working distributed inference platform; and
2. reproducible evidence that explains why it works, where it fails, and what each design choice buys us.

Start with the [product requirements](docs/PRD.md), then read [RFC 0001](docs/rfcs/0001-serving-path.md) alongside the first implementation.

## Current milestone: v0.6 three-node Raft control plane

```mermaid

    O["Configuration client"] --> L["Raft leader"]
    L --> B["Follower B"]
    L --> C["Follower C"]
    B -->|"majority commit"| S["Committed routing snapshot"]
    C --> S
    S -. "poll, revision only increases" .-> G["Rust gateway"]
    G --> W["Inference workers"]
```

v0.6 adds three persistent Rust control-plane nodes. Randomized election
deadlines select one leader per term; `RequestVote` protects log freshness;
`AppendEntries` replicates and repairs logs; majority commit makes one ordered
routing history durable; and deterministic application exposes the same
configuration on every node.

The gateway polls committed snapshots and applies only increasing revisions.
Raft never enters the inference request path: every request clones one immutable
worker-pool snapshot, so elections do not interrupt routing, retries, or
streaming.

The retained proof kills two successive leaders. Re-elections finish in
364.540 ms and 243.314 ms, writes continue on two nodes, restarted nodes repair
their logs, all three finish at revision 6, and all 12 gateway requests sent
during the elections succeed.

## Run it

Prerequisites: stable Rust, Python 3, and `curl`.

```bash
cargo test --workspace
./scripts/proof-v0.1.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.0.2.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.0.3.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.0.4.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.0.5.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.0.6.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.0.7.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.0.8.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.0.9.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.5.sh
./scripts/proof-v0.6.sh
```

Or run each process manually:

```bash
FAKE_WORKER_ID=worker-a FAKE_WORKER_BIND=127.0.0.1:9001 cargo run -p fake-worker
FAKE_WORKER_ID=worker-b FAKE_WORKER_BIND=127.0.0.1:9002 cargo run -p fake-worker
FAKE_WORKER_ID=worker-c FAKE_WORKER_BIND=127.0.0.1:9003 cargo run -p fake-worker
INFERLAB_ROUTING_POLICY=least-in-flight \
INFERLAB_WORKER_CONCURRENCY=2 \
INFERLAB_ADMISSION_QUEUE_CAPACITY=4 \
INFERLAB_REQUEST_DEADLINE_MS=30000 \
INFERLAB_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_MS=5000 \
INFERLAB_MAX_RETRIES=2 \
INFERLAB_RETRY_BUDGET_PERCENT=10 \
INFERLAB_CIRCUIT_WINDOW_SIZE=10 \
INFERLAB_CIRCUIT_MIN_REQUESTS=5 \
INFERLAB_CIRCUIT_FAILURE_RATE_PERCENT=50 \
INFERLAB_CIRCUIT_OPEN_MS=5000 \
INFERLAB_WORKERS='worker-a=http://127.0.0.1:9001,worker-b=http://127.0.0.1:9002,worker-c=http://127.0.0.1:9003' \
  cargo run -p gateway
```

Then stream a completion:

```bash
curl -iN http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"inferlab-fake","stream":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"teach me streaming"}]}'
```

The `x-inferlab-worker` response header proves which worker served the request. The SSE body ends with `data: [DONE]`.

The circuit defaults use a 10-outcome window, at least 5 samples, a 50%
transient-failure threshold, and a 5-second open period. `/internal/workers`
exposes each state, recent error rate, rejected routes, probes, openings, and
recoveries.

Run the batch service separately:

```bash
INFERLAB_BATCH_WAL=./data/inferlab-batch.wal \
  cargo run -p batch-queue
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:8081` by default.

For the control-plane milestone, see
[RFC 0011](docs/rfcs/0011-raft-control-plane.md), the
[phase 11 learning guide](docs/learning/phase-11-raft-control-plane.md), and the
[retained v0.6 evidence](docs/results/v0.6/README.md). RFC 0010 and the
[phase 10 guide](docs/learning/phase-10-durable-batch-queue.md) remain the
durable queue reference.

## Learning loop

Every milestone follows the same loop:

1. **Predict:** write the mental model and expected result.
2. **Build:** implement the smallest vertical behavior.
3. **Break:** inject the failure the design claims to handle.
4. **Measure:** save raw data and latency/throughput summaries.
5. **Explain:** compare prediction with evidence and record surprises.

This is the scientific method applied to systems engineering. A green test proves a specified behavior; a benchmark tests a performance hypothesis; a failure test validates a recovery claim. None is interchangeable with the others.
